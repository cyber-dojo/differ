Fix sonarscan vulnerabilities (or bypass)

When check_coverage produces incorrect zero values for, eg, app.lines.total raise an error instead of passing quietly.
  This was caused by an incorrect grouping in coverage.rb, eg add_group(code_tab) { |src| src.filename !~ test_re }
  See if a count of the matches can be kept, and if it is zero, raise an exception.
