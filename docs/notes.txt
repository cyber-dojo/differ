Planned refactorings...

1)
diff_lines() does not squash stdout/stderr/status into the diff.
Instead web's diff/review page handles these separately as non-files
via a $.getJSON('/model/kata_event') call from the browser.

2)
diff_lines() and diff_summary() collapse into a single diff()
function which can be passed options {lines:true, counts:true}
- diff_lines()   == diff(..., {lines:true, counts:true})
- diff_summary() == diff(..., {counts:true})

3)
Update the readme and docs/api.md

4)
returned json is not keyed on the name of the calling method.

5)
differ service is based on Sinatra
