Planned refactorings...

1)
diff_lines() does not squash stdout/stderr/status into the diff.
Instead web handles these separately as non-files.

2)
diff_lines() and diff_summary() collapse into a single diff()
function which can be passed options lines:true, counts:true

3)
Update the readme and docs/api.md
